**_IT this week_**

Today in It we were looking at your different personalities, and who you try to be online, in front of a camera, at home or at school. I found this interesting, as I had never really thought of that before. 

For half of the lesson we were designing a "My Life" poster, which had to be made on A3 paper. I found this task quite difficult, as I wanted to put down so many things, but I had to limit them.
