This includes the cost of one copy of the WIGT toolkit per school.

The [Astra Outstanding Teaching Programme (OTP) ](http://www.astra-alliance.com/308/outstanding-teacher-programme-otp-secondary)is now in its third year and has been developed to enable teachers in the alliance who are currently identified as good to work together, with the support of outstanding practitioners in their own school, to develop and refine their practice, undertake professional enquiry and embed new skills and knowledge into their teaching so it is consistently outstanding.  The programme will launch in September 2016 and will be facilitated by outstanding practitioners in the Alliance.
